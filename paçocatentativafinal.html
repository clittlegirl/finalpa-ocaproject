        <h2>From Brazil do Lisbon</h2> 
        <p>
          Born in Brazil, I was abandoned on the street with my brother Pantufa,
          I was only 2 weeks old when my mom, Camila, found us.
          Since then my life has changed a lot!
          In 2019 we moved to Lisbon, left the streets and came to Europe.

        <p>
          My family is puuuuuuuuuuurfect, and I love they so much. 
          I have a lot of uncles and aunts, sometimes they don't quite understand my scared way of being.
          My mom is the best in the world and she is very understanding with me.
          My brother, well he is my brother.

        <h2>I am not fat!</h2>
        <p>
          I used to be a very round kitten, but I like to think that they are
           phases and, sometimes, we are fatter and sometimes thinner.
           The truth is that my mother loves to caress my belly, so the bigger the better.

      <h3>Why adopot?</h3>
      <p>
        It goes without saying that when you adopt a rescue pet,
         you’re saving a life—but you’re actually saving more than one.
         By adopting, you’re helping make space for another animal in 
         need and helping to give them the opportunity to become beloved pets. 
      </p>
